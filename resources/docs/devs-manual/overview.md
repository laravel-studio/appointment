## Description

This `documentation` is only for developers. This `documentation` tells about the `structure`, `packages` and the `codes` of the `system`. The `framework` used in the `Appointment Management System`  is `Laravel`. All the `validation` and `authentication` are mostly written in `Controller` but `route` level `authentication` is implemented also, so that noone can access the urls by manually typing it in the `address-bar` of browser. Visit the diffrent modules to know more about the system.
